You are part of a team that is preparing a report on the alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) market in the United States, with a particular focus on the state of Washington.\n\n**Business Problem.** Your job is to **provide a characterization of the AFV market in the US and in Washington, including data about energy efficiency of the vehicles over time, geographical distribution, etc.**\n\n**Analytical Context.** You will be working with the [`vehicles.xlsm`](/extended.eda_basic_data_wrangling_excel_fellow/files/data/vehicles.xlsm) Excel file that contains four tabs of raw data. The first one is the `sales` tab, which contains aggregated sales figures for the US; the second one is the `models` tab, which contains data on the EV type. The third tab is the `range_data` tab, which has data about ranges of electrical vehicles. These data files come from the US Department of Energy. The last one is `ev_data tab`, which is a census of all the electric vehicles in circulation in Washington state. This census data comes from the Washington State Department of Licensing.\n\nInstructions: For this extended case, you will only submit one Excel file with your answers written in the `ANSWER` tab. Each question will have its specific designated field that you will be placing your answers into. Continue for further instructions.",

Some AFVs are highly efficient and, perhaps more importantly, have reduced greenhouse gas emissions relative to traditional vehicles, which makes them an important part of environmental recovery and protection plans around the globe.\n\nThis chart shows the distribution of light-duty AFVs in the US as of Dec. 31, 2018:\n\n![](data/images/light-duty-afv-registrat.png)\n\n**Legend:** *FFV:* Flexible fuel vehicle (cars that run on biofuels or mixtures of gas and biofuels - most of the FFVs in the US operate primarily on gasoline, see [here](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/flexible_fuel.html) for more information). *HEV:* Hybrid electric vehicle. *CNG:* Compressed natural gas. *EV:* Electric vehicle. *PHEV:* Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. PHEVs and EVs are often counted as a single category, Plug-in electric vehicles (*PEV*s). **Source:** Alternative Fuels Data Center, US Department of Energy.\n\nNote: Chart totals add to 99.99 due to rounding.

E85 (or flex fuel) is a gasoline-ethanol blend containing 51% to 83% ethanol, depending on geography and season. According to IHS Markit, as of 2017, there were more than 21 million FFVs in the United States.

It is also useful to start with `Text to Columns`, available under the `Data` tab, and split by `-`. Notice that all years have four characters and all ranges have three.
